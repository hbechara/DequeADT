# DequeADT

Implement a queue-like data structure that supports insertion and deletion
at both the front and the back of the queue.

The following methods need to be included:

* `D.add_first(e)`: Add element `e` to the front of deque `D`.
* `D.add_last(e)`: Add element `e` to  the back of deque `D`.
* `D.delete_first()`: Remove and return the fist element from deque `D`
* `D.first()`: Return the first element of deque `D`
* `D.last()`: Return the last element of deque `D`
* `D.is_empty()`: Return `True` if deque `D` does not contain any elements.
* `len(D)`: Return the number of elements in deque `D`
